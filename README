Whaaw! Media Player installation instructions.
Written by Jeff Bailes.

Before you try to install or run Whaaw! Media Player you should check that you
have all the required dependencies, these include:
python >= 2.5
pygtk >= 2.8 (Not too sure about the version, 2.8 should work fine though)
gstreamer-python >= 0.10

I think that's about it (well, the ones I know about), the package names may
differ depending on your distribution, you will also need other gstreamer
packages depending on the type of media you wish to play.

Now, onto the building etc etc.
-To compile all the python files type ./make.py
-Then to install them type ./make.py install
--There are --prefix and --destdir options (see ./make.py --help for more
information) (PREFIX and DESTDIR environmantal variables can also be used).
--This will only install the compiled files, to install the source files
aswell type ./make.py installsrc instead.

Alternitavely you can type './make.py all install' to compile and install in
one go.
eg. To install to /usr:
./make.py -p /usr all install


Also if you use a tool like checkinstall, I have added a Makefile which just
executes the correct commands for 'make' and 'make install'.  So it **should**
work, I haven't actually tested this though.

To run it afterwards, use whaawmp to start Whaaw! Media Player.
