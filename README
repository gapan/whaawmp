GTK3 branch.  This is more of a test to see how doable it is to get whaawmp to
run with GTK3, and eventually taking over as the main toolkit.
So far it doesn't work that well.

Whaaw! Media Player installation instructions.
Written by Jeff Bailes.

Before you try to install or run Whaaw! Media Player you should check that you
have all the required dependencies, these include:
python2 >= 2.5
pygtk >= 2.12
gstreamer-python2 >= 0.10
gstreamer-base >= 0.10.17
gstreamer-good >= 0.10 (for the videobalance and goom plugins)
py2xdg

Optional dependencies include:
dbus-python >= 0.80 ? (Not too sure about the version)
gstreamer-bad >= 0.10.8 (compiled with resindvd support) for DVD menu support
python2-rsvg (Draws the background picture, not important for anything much)

I think that's about it (well, the ones I know about), the package names may
differ depending on your distribution, you will also need other gstreamer
packages depending on the type of media you wish to play.

NOTE: Installation is not needed to use/test whaawmp.  It can be run fine by
just running './whaawmp.sh'.  Though if you really want to install it you can
use the setup.py script, however there is no uninstall script so a package
manager is recommended.  See the below for a list of files which are
installed.

Now, onto the building etc etc.
-To compile & install the files use: python2 setup.py install
--There are --prefix and --root options (see ./setup.py --help for more
information)
-For checkinstall run: 'checkinstall ./setup.py install'
-If python3 is the default python on your system, setup.py should
automatically detect that it's being run by python2 and modify the
executable scripts accordingly.

eg. To install to /usr:
python2 setup.py install --prefix=/usr

To run it afterwards, use whaawmp to start Whaaw! Media Player.

A list of files installed, and should be removed if uninstall is required:
(prefix=/usr by default)
${prefix}/bin/{whaawmp, whaaw-thumbnailer}
${prefix}/lib/python-${pyver}/site-packages/whaawmp-${whaaw-ver}-py${pyver}.egg-info
${prefix}/lib/python-${pyver}/site-packages/whaawmp (entire directory)
${prefix}/share/applications/whaawmp.desktop
${prefix}/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/whaawmp.mo (list of languages in po dir)
${prefix}/share/pixmaps/whaawmp.svg
${prefix}/share/thumbnailers/whaaw-thumbnailer.desktop
${prefix}/share/whaawmp (entire directory)

There is also a video converter packaged with whaawmp, though it is not
intsalled, as it is in a very buggy alpha phase at the moment.  It was
more of an experiment in seeing if I could code a vp8 transcoder in
gstreamer, it has limited codec support and probably fails a lot.
